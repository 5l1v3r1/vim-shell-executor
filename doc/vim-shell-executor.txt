1. Intro                                             *vim-shell-executor-intro*

A simple way to execute Vim buffer contents with a shell command and view the
results in a split window.

I find this most useful for SQL queries, however this will work with any program
that can be called from the shell.

2. Requirements                               *vim-shell-executor-requirements*

No additional requires are needed for this plugin. Only the shell programs you
would like to run.

3. Usage                                             *vim-shell-executor-usage*

The plugin provides two commands.
`
ExecuteBuffer
ExecuteSelction
`
These commands allow you to execute either the entire buffer or the visually
selected region. The first line passed to the plugin is the shell command that
will be used to run the remaining lines of code. For example to run a mysql query
the first line would be the information you would enter to connect to the database.
The remaining lines are the query that you would like to execute. For example
to run a mysql query on the example database would could use the following.
``` shell
mysql -t -u root example
select * from mysql_example_table;
```
